                <h2>City within a Park</h2>
                <p>Toronto is sometimes referred to as a city within a park. With well-known spots such as High Park, the Toronto Islands, and Riverdale Park (East and West), Toronto is awash in green. Don't forget the many ravines, and Canada's first national urban park: Rouge National Urban Park.</p>

					<h3>High Park</h3>
					<p>High Park is one of Toronto's largest and best known parks. It features a large off-leash dog area, a large pond known as Grenadier Pond, and a large number of meandering trails. High Park is also one of the best places in Toronto to check out the cherry blossoms in April or May</p>

					<h3>Toronto Islands</h3>
					<p>Accessible only by ferry, and featuring one of the only car-free neighbourhoods in Canada, the Toronto Islands boast many acres of parkland, excellent boatways, and even an amusement park, Centreville Amusement Park.</p>

					<h3>Christie Pits Park</h3>
					<p>The sides of the pits are highly sloped, as a result of which most of the area of the park sits well below street level. The slopes are used in winter for tobogganing and related activities. Garrison Creek runs under the park, converted to a storm sewer at the turn of the 20th century.</p>

					<h3>Trinity Bellwoods Park</h3>
					<p>Trinity Bellwoods is a favourite place for local residents to walk their dogs. The ravine, known as the dog bowl, is the designated leash-free area. The park is a destination for many to picnic, play sports, and enjoy nature. The park's baseball diamond is officially named SkyDome in reference to the popular former name of the Rogers Centre.</p>
